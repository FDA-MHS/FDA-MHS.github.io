We are the Future Doctors of America Club, and we aim to better educate ourselves about present day medicine and what a medical career will look like moving forward.

## Mission Statement

The Future Doctors of America Club empowers students to explore the medical field through leadership, service, and academic achievement. Our mission is to foster academic curiosity, promote equitable access to medical knowledge, and encourage personal growth. Through hands-on experiences, mentorship, and health-focused initiatives, we equip students to lead with compassion and make meaningful contributions to the future of medicine.

## Club Achievements

Last year, our club focused on exploring medical pathways and developing real-world experience. Members analyzed various careers within the medical field and reflected on their personal strengths to identify roles that best aligned with their skills and interests. Students practiced professional outreach by sending cold emails to physicians to secure shadowing experiences and internships during the second semester and over the summer.

This year, our club has grown exponentially to 50 members. To expand the club, we are working on six student-led projects designed to promote medical learning, build leadership skills, and engage even more youth in the study of medicine.

\## Club Symbols

Our club symbol is the primary medical symbol, the caduceus, based on the Hermetic astrological principles of using the planets and stars to heal the sick.

Our club mascot is a dragon named "Lavendar." Lavender is used medicinally for calming anxiety, improving mood, and promoting better sleep. It also offers potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits, supporting skin health and wound healing, making it common use in hospitals for support during stressful events.
